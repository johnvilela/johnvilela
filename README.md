**Hey, I'm John Vilela! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·  working remotely for [GSW](https://www.gsw.com.br/). Lately, I'm making a lot of cool applications with Node, React and Angular. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:johnvvilela@gmail.com). I'm looking forward to connecting with you :)
